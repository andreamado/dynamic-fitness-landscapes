# Simulations
This folder contains:
- the source code to the Rust programs for the simulations. Contains three programs:
  - create_landscapes, that creates landscapes to be used by the other two programs
  - convergence, that runs simulations and records detailed information and graphs of the fitness landscapes
  - ecoevo_landscapes, that runs simulations and records statistical information on population and fitness landscapes
- run_simulations.py - An example script to run a batch of simulations in parallel
