This repository contains the code for reproducing the simulations and results for the "Ecological tradeoffs lead to complex evolutionary trajectories and sustained diversity on dynamic fitness landscapes" manuscript published in Journal of Physics [DOI: 10.1088/1751-8121/ad30d0](https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ad30d0) ([bioRxiv DOI: 10.1101/2023.10.11.561986](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.11.561986)) by [André Amado](https://andreamado.github.io/me/) and [Claudia Bank](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4730-758X). For detailed information, please read our manuscript.

It is organized in two sections:
- simulations folder, containing the Rust code for the simulations
- figures folder, containing the Python code and data for plotting the figures

The code for the simulations and figures was written by André Amado.
